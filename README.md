## Advanced Customization  

[Bright Data’s CAPTCHA Solver](https://github.com/luminati-io/Captcha-solver) allows for advanced customization to fine-tune solving logic for specific scenarios. See the example below. 

### **Custom Options for DataDome Challenges**  
```javascript
// Default options for solving DataDome CAPTCHA challenges
function getCaptchaOptions(customOptions = {}) {
  const defaultOptions = {
    timeout: 30000, // Maximum time (in ms) to wait for CAPTCHA solving
    selector: '#datadome-captcha', // CSS selector for the CAPTCHA element
    check_timeout: 500, // Interval (in ms) to check the CAPTCHA's status
    success_selector: '#captcha-success', // CSS selector for the success confirmation element
    wait_networkidle: { timeout: 1000 }, // Wait until the network is idle for 1 second
    debug: false // Debug mode (disabled by default)
  };

  return { ...defaultOptions, ...customOptions };
}

// Example usage
const ddOptions = getCaptchaOptions({
  timeout: 40000, // Override default timeout
  wait_networkidle: { timeout: 500 }, // Override network idle timeout
  debug: true // Enable debug mode
});

// Debugging support
if (ddOptions.debug) {
  console.log('CAPTCHA-solving options:', ddOptions);
}

// Validate selectors
if (!document.querySelector(ddOptions.selector)) {
  throw new Error(`CAPTCHA element not found using selector: ${ddOptions.selector}`);
}

if (!document.querySelector(ddOptions.success_selector)) {
  console.warn(`Success element not found using selector: ${ddOptions.success_selector}`);
}

// Error handling example
try {
  // Your CAPTCHA-solving logic here
  solveCaptcha(ddOptions);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to solve CAPTCHA:', error.message);
  // Handle the error (e.g., retry logic, logging, etc.)
}
```
## **Event Monitoring**  
Track CAPTCHA-solving events to handle advanced use cases:  
- `Captcha.detected`: CAPTCHA detected and solving has started.  
- `Captcha.solveFinished`: CAPTCHA solved successfully.  
- `Captcha.solveFailed`: CAPTCHA solving failed.
